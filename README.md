# K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN)

K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.

K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.
