# K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN)

K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.

K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.

## Why do we need a K-NN Algorithm?

Suppose there are two categories, i.e., Category A and Category B, and we have a new data point x1, so this data point will lie in which of these categories. To solve this type of problem, we need a K-NN algorithm. With the help of K-NN, we can easily identify the category or class of a particular dataset.
